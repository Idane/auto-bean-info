# auto-bean-info
Automatically create a BeanInfo for all your @Entity and @MappedSuperclass and super classes and interfaces, to speed up class lookup when a JPA application starts.

This is not yet hosted on any maven repository, so clone, build it, include in dependencies of the project for which you need BeanInfos.
